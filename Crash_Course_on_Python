# Sometimes we don't want a function to simply run and finish. We may want a function to manipulate data we passed it and then return the result to us.
This is where the concept of return values comes in handy. We use the return keyword in a function, which tells the function to pass data back.
When we call the function, we can store the returned value in a variable.
Return values allow our functions to be more flexible and powerful, so they can be reused and called multiple times.

# Functions can even return multiple values. Just don't forget to store all returned values in variables! You could also have a function return nothing, in which case the function simply exits.

Comparison Operators
In Python, we can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison is made, Python returns a boolean result, or simply a True or False.
    To check if two values are the same, we can use the equality operator: ==
    To check if two values are not the same, we can use the not equals operator: !=
We can also check if values are greater than or lesser than each other using > and <.
If you try to compare data types that arenâ€™t compatible, like checking if a string is greater than an integer, Python will throw a TypeError.

We can make very complex comparisons by joining statements together using logical operators with our comparison operators.
These logical operators are and, or, and not. When using the and operator, both sides of the statement being evaluated must be true for the whole statement to be true.
When using the or operator, if either side of the comparison is true, then the whole statement is true.
Lastly, the not operator simply inverts the value of the statement immediately following it.
So if a statement evaluates to True, and we put the not operator in front of it, it would become False.
#------------------------------------------------

def hint_username(username):
    if len(username) < 3:
        print("Invalid username. It must be at least 3 character long")
hint_username("asd")

#------------------------------------------------
def is_positive(number):
  if (number > 0):
    return True
  else:
      return None
print (is_positive (13))
#------------------------------------------------
We can use the concept of branching to have our code alter its execution sequence depending on the values of variables.
We can use an if statement to evaluate a comparison.
We start with the if keyword, followed by our comparison.
We end the line with a colon. The body of the if statement is then indented to the right.
If the comparison is True, the code inside the if body is executed.
If the comparison evaluates to False, then the code block is skipped and will not be run.
#------------------------------------------------

def hint_username(username):
    if len(username) < 3:
        print("Invalid username. It must be at least 3 character long")
    else:
        print("Valid username")
hint_username("asdf")

#------------------------------------------------

def is_even(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return True
    return False
print (is_even(24))

# else Statements and the Modulo Operator
# We just covered the if statement, which executes code if an evaluation is true and skips the code if itâ€™s false.
 But what if we wanted the code to do something different if the evaluation is false? We can do this using the else statement.
  The else statement follows an if block, and is composed of the keyword else followed by a colon.
   The body of the else statement is indented to the right, and will be expected if the above if statement doesnâ€™t execute.

# We also touched on the modulo operator, which is represented by the percent sign: %.
This operator performs integer division, but only returns the remainder of this division operation.
 If weâ€™re dividing 5 by 2, the quotient is 2, and the remainder is 1. Two 2s can go into 5, leaving 1 left over.
 So 5%2 would return 1. Dividing 10 by 5 would give us a quotient of 2 with no remainder, since 5 can go into 10 twice with nothing left over.
  In this case, 10%2 would return 0, as there is no remainder.

# ------------------------------------------------

def hint_username(username):
    if len(username) < 3:
        print("Invalid username. It must be at least 3 character long")
    elif len(username) > 15:
        print("Invalid username. It must be at most 15 character long")
    else:
        print("Valid username")
hint_username("asdfAsdsadsdsfdfdsfdsfdsfdsfdsfdfdsfsdfdfdf")

# ------------------------------------------------
#  Building off of the if and else blocks, which allow us to branch our code depending on the evaluation of one statement,
 the elif statement allows us even more comparisons to perform more complex branching.
 Very similar to the if statements, an elif statement starts with the elif keyword, followed by a comparison to be evaluated.
 This is followed by a colon, and then the code block on the next line, indented to the right.
  An elif statement must follow an if statement, and will only be evaluated if the if statement was evaluated as false.
   You can include multiple elif statements to build complex branching in your code to do all kinds of powerful things!

Conditionals Cheat Sheet
In earlier videos, we took a look at some of the built-in Python operators that allow us to compare values, and some logical operators we can use to combine values.
 We also learned how to use operators in if-else-elif blocks.

Itâ€™s a lot to learn but, with practice, it gets easier to remember it all.
In the meantime, this handy cheat sheet gives you all the information you need at a glance.

Comparison operators
a == b: a is equal to b
a != b: a is different than b
a < b: a is smaller than b
a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b
a > b: a is bigger than b
a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b
Logical operators
a and b: True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.
a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.
not a: True if a is False, False if a is True.
Branching blocks

In Python, we branch our code using if, else and elif. This is the branching syntax:

if condition1:
    if-block
elif condition2:
    elif-block
else:
    else-block

Remember:
The if-block will be executed if condition1 is True.
The elif-block will be executed if condition1 is False and condition2 is True.
The else block will be executed when all the specified conditions are false.

# Common Pitfalls With Variable Initialization
# You'll want to watch out for a common mistake: forgetting to initialize variables.
If you try to use a variable without first initializing it, you'll run into a NameError.
This is the Python interpreter catching the mistake and telling you that youâ€™re using an undefined variable.
The fix is pretty simple: initialize the variable by assigning the variable a value before you use it.
#
# Another common mistake to watch out for that can be a little trickier to spot is forgetting to initialize variables with the correct value.
  If you use a variable earlier in your code and then reuse it later in a loop without first setting the value to something you want,
  your code may wind up doing something you didn't expect.
  Don't forget to initialize your variables before using them
# ------------------------------------------------

#Infinite loops and Code Blocks
# Another easy mistake that can happen when using loops is introducing an infinite loop.
# An infinite loop means the code block in the loop will continue to execute and never stop.
# This can happen when the condition being evaluated in a while loop doesn't change.
# Pay close attention to your variables and what possible values they can take. Think about unexpected values, like zero.

# In the Coursera code blocks, you may see an error message that reads "Evaluation took more than 5 seconds to complete."
# This means that the code encountered an infinite loop, and it timed out after 5 seconds.
# You should take a closer look at the code and variables to spot where the infinite loop is.

# Use for loops when there's a sequence of elements that you want to iterate.
# Use while loops when you want to repeat an action until a condition changes

# ------------------------------------------------
# For loops allow you to iterate over a sequence of values. Let's take the example from the beginning of the video:
#
# for x in range(5):
#
#   print(x)
#
# Similar to if statements and while loops, for loops begin with the keyword for with a colon at the end of the line.
# Just like in function definitions, while loops and if statements, the body of the for loop begins on the next line and is indented to the right.
# But what about the stuff in between the for keyword and the colon? In our example, weâ€™re using the range() function to create a sequence of numbers that our for loop can iterate over.
# In this case, our variable x points to the current element in the sequence as the for loop iterates over the sequence of numbers.
# Keep in mind that in Python and many programming languages, a range of numbers will start at 0, and the list of numbers generated will be one less than the provided value.
# So range(5) will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4, for a total of 5 numbers.
#
# Bringing this all together, the range(5) function will create a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4.
# Our for loop will iterate over this sequence of numbers, one at a time, making the numbers accessible via the variable x and the code within our loop body will execute for each iteration through the sequence.
# So for the first loop, x will contain 0, the next loop, 1, and so on until it reaches 4. Once the end of the sequence comes up, the loop will exit and the code will continue.
#
# The power of for loops comes from the fact that it can iterate over a sequence of any kind of data, not just a range of numbers.
# You can use for loops to iterate over a list of strings, such as usernames or lines in a file.
#
# Not sure whether to use a for loop or a while loop? Remember that a while loop is great for performing an action over and over until a condition has changed.
# A for loop works well when you want to iterate over a sequence of elements.

# A Closer Look at the Range() Function
# Previously we had used the range() function by passing it a single parameter, and it generated a sequence of numbers from 0 to one less than we specified.
# But the range() function can do much more than that.
# We can pass in two parameters: the first specifying our starting point, the second specifying the end point.
# Don't forget that the sequence generated won't contain the last element; it will stop one before the parameter specified.

# The range() function can take a third parameter, too.
# This third parameter lets you  alter the size of each step.
# So instead of creating a sequence of numbers incremented by 1, you can generate a sequence of numbers that are incremented by 5.
# To quickly recap the range() function when passing one, two, or three parameters:

# One parameter will create a sequence, one-by-one, from zero to one less than the parameter.
# Two parameters will create a sequence, one-by-one, from the first parameter to one less than the second parameter.
# Three parameters will create a sequence starting with the first parameter and stopping before the second parameter, but this time increasing each step by the third parameter.

Loops Cheat Sheet
Check out below for a run down of the syntax for while loops and for loops.

while condition:
    body

While Loops
A while loop executes the body of the loop while the condition remains True.

Syntax:
while condition:
    body
Things to watch out for!

Failure to initialize variables. Make sure all the variables used in the loopâ€™s condition  are initialized before the loop.
Unintended infinite loops. Make sure that the body of the loop modifies the variables used in the condition, so that the loop will eventually end for all possible values of the variables.

Typical use:
While loops are mostly used when thereâ€™s an unknown number of operations to be performed, and a condition needs to be checked at each iteration.

For Loops
A for loop iterates over a sequence of elements, executing the body of the loop for each element in the sequence.

Syntax:
for variable in sequence
    body

#The range() function:

range() generates a sequence of integer numbers. It can take one, two, or three parameters:

range(n): 0, 1, 2, ... n-1
range(x,y): x, x+1, x+2, ... y-1
range(p,q,r): p, p+r, p+2r, p+3r, ... q-1 (if it's a valid increment)

Common pitfalls:
Forgetting that the upper limit of a range() isnâ€™t included.
Iterating over non-sequences. Integer numbers arenâ€™t iterable. Strings are iterable letter by letter, but that might not be what you want.

Typical use:
For loops are mostly used when there's a pre-defined sequence or range of numbers to iterate.

Break & Continue
You can interrupt both while and for loops using the break keyword. We normally do this to interrupt a cycle due to a separate condition.

You can use the continue keyword to skip the current iteration and continue with the next one. This is typically used to jump ahead when some of the elements of the sequence arenâ€™t relevant.

# Question 2
# Fill in the blanks to make the factorial function return the factorial of n.
# Then, print the first 10 factorials (from 0 to 9) with the corresponding number.
# Remember that the factorial of a number is defined as the product of an integer and all integers before it.
# For example, the factorial of five (5!) is equal to 1*2*3*4*5=120. Also recall that the factorial of zero (0!) is equal to 1.

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for x in range(1,(n+1)):
        result = result * x
    return result

for n in range(0,10):
    print(n, factorial(n+1))
